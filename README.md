# Battle-Field
This is my first code project in the first semester python class at CMU.  

This project is an interactive implementation of the classic game Battleship, built using a custom simulation framework. The program supports three main phases: automatic setup of the computer’s ships, interactive ship placement by the user, and full gameplay where both sides take turns guessing ship locations. \n

Setup Enemy Board – Generate grids, create and validate ships, place them randomly, and render the board.
User Ship Placement – Allow the user to select ship locations via mouse clicks, validate ship placement, and update the board dynamically.
Gameplay – Implement turn-based play where the user and computer take guesses, update boards accordingly, detect wins/losses/draws, and allow restarting the game. 

Features include grid rendering, ship validation, random computer moves, win/loss/draw detection, and the ability to restart and play multiple rounds.

Although the computer agent's guessing is niave, this project shows my coding ability after three month's learning and my logical orgnization ability when tackling a complicated, multiple-stages, project.

For running:
Run the "battleship.py" file. The "battleship-test.py" file shows the test cases used when coding.
