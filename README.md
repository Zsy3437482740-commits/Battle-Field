# Battle-Field  

This is my first code project in the first-semester Python class at CMU.  

This project is an interactive implementation of the classic game **Battleship**, built using a custom simulation framework. The program supports three main phases:  

- **Setup Enemy Board** – Generate grids, create and validate ships, place them randomly, and render the board.  
- **User Ship Placement** – Allow the user to select ship locations via mouse clicks, validate ship placement, and update the board dynamically.  
- **Gameplay** – Implement turn-based play where the user and computer take guesses, update boards accordingly, detect wins/losses/draws, and allow restarting the game.  

Features include grid rendering, ship validation, random computer moves, win/loss/draw detection, and the ability to restart and play multiple rounds.  

Although the computer agent’s guessing is naive, this project demonstrates my coding ability after just three months of learning Python, as well as my logical organization skills when tackling a complex, multi-stage project.

## Running the Project  

- Run `battleship.py` to start the game.  
- Use `battleship_test.py` to view and run the test cases used during development.
